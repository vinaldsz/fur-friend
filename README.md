# **Fur Friend - Virtual Pet Companion**

**Submitted by - Vinal Dalcy Dsouza**

## Overview

Fur Friend is a virtual pet companion designed to provide users with emotional support and engagement through interactive pet care. Users can adopt, nurture, and interact with their pets while receiving affirmations and companionship.

## Features

- **Pet Adoption:** Choose from different pets (Dog, Cat, Rabbit) with unique traits.
- **Pet Status Dashboard:** Monitor health, hunger, happiness, and energy levels.
- **Interactive Engagement:** Play, feed, cuddle, and care for your pet.
- **Daily Affirmations:** Receive uplifting messages for mental well-being.

## Target Audience

- Individuals seeking emotional companionship.
- Children learning responsibility through virtual pet care.
- People looking for a fun and interactive digital experience.

## How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fur-friend.git
cd fur-friend
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the server:

```sh
npm start
```

## Usage

The `Usage` folder in the project highlights the usage of the various classes in the `Solution` folder.

Run an example file:

```sh
node <Filename.js>
```

Example:

```sh
node AdoptValidPet.js
```

Note that `Main.js` provides an interactive console for the project.

## OOP Pillars

### 1. Encapsulation

In `Pet` class: Encapsulates the species and status of a pet, managing them through class methods. The status for a pet is updated through `Pet` using `updateStatus()`.

### 2. Abstraction

- The `InteractionHandler` class abstracts away the complexity of pet interactions. Users don't need to know how status updates work; they just call methods like `play()`, `feed()`, etc.
- `PetFactory` abstracts the pet creation process - users don't need to know the details of how pets are constructed.

### 3. Inheritance

`Cat`, `Dog`, `Rabbit` all inherit basic pet attributes and methods from the `Pet` class.

### 4. Polymorphism

`Cat`, `Dog`, `Rabbit` all have `makeSound()` method in their classes, which is also present in the base class. However, these methods are overridden in child classes to provide customized noises made by the pet.

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

Each class has a single responsibility:

- `User`: Manages user details and adopted pets.
- `PetSpecies`: Stores available pet species.
- `InteractionHandler`: Handles pet interactions.
- `GameManager`: Manages the game state.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle

- `InteractionHandler` allows new interactions to be added without modifying existing ones.
- `PetSpecies.speciesList` lets new pets be added without modifying the adoption logic.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle

- Objects of `Pet` subclasses (like `Dog`, `Cat`, `Rabbit`) can be substituted for `Pet` objects without affecting the behavior of the system.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle

- `Cat`, `Rabbit`, and `Dog` all have different activities that they can do. For example, a `Rabbit` wouldnâ€™t fetch. The activities specific to `Rabbit` are only put together in the `Rabbit` class, likewise for `Dog` and `Cat`, ensuring classes don't force unnecessary methods on their clients.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

- `Pet` class depends on abstractions (`StatusManager`) rather than the concrete `PetStatus` class.

## Design Patterns

### 1. Singleton Pattern

**Good Example:** The `GameManager` ensures that only one instance of the game exists, managing users and pets efficiently.

```js
export class GameManager {
    static instance;

    constructor() {
        if (GameManager.instance) {
            return GameManager.instance;
        }
        this.users = [];
        GameManager.instance = this;
    }

    addUser(user) {
        this.users.push(user);
    }
}

// Usage
const game1 = new GameManager();
const game2 = new GameManager();
console.log(game1 === game2); // true (Same instance)
```

**Bad Example (Breaking Singleton):**

Here, multiple instances of `GameManager` can be created, leading to an inconsistent game state.

```js
export class GameManager {
    constructor() {
        this.users = [];
    }

    addUser(user) {
        this.users.push(user);
    }
}

// Usage
const game1 = new GameManager();
const game2 = new GameManager();
console.log(game1 === game2); // false (Different instances)
```

### 2. Factory Pattern

**Good Example:** The `PetFactory` creates pets dynamically based on the species provided, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

```js
import { Dog } from "./Dog.js"; 
import { Cat } from "./Cat.js";
import { Rabbit } from "./Rabbit.js";

export class PetFactory {
    static createPet(name, species) {
        switch (species) {
            case "Dog": return new Dog(name);
            case "Cat": return new Cat(name);
            case "Rabbit": return new Rabbit(name);
            default: throw new Error("Invalid species");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
const myPet = PetFactory.createPet("Buddy", "Dog");
console.log(myPet.makeSound());
```

**Bad Example (Without Factory Pattern):**

```js
import { Dog } from "./Dog.js";
import { Cat } from "./Cat.js";
import { Rabbit } from "./Rabbit.js";

const createPet = (name, species) => {
    if (species === "Dog") {
        return new Dog(name);
    } else if (species === "Cat") {
        return new Cat(name);
    } else if (species === "Rabbit") {
        return new Rabbit(name);
    }
    throw new Error("Invalid species");
};

// Usage
const pet1 = createPet("Buddy", "Dog");
const pet2 = createPet("Whiskers", "Cat");
```

The issue here is the if-else chain, making it harder to maintain and extend when adding new species.

### 3. Strategy Pattern

**Good Example:** The `PetStatus` class allows different ways to update the petâ€™s status, keeping `Pet` flexible and avoiding hardcoded logic.

```js
export class PetStatus {
    constructor() {
        this.status = { hunger: 100, happiness: 100 };
    }
    
    updateStatus(activity) {
        if (activity === "feed") this.status.hunger += 10;
        if (activity === "play") this.status.happiness += 10;
    }
    
    getStatus() {
        return this.status;
    }
}
```

**Bad Example (Without Strategy Pattern):**

```js
export class Pet {
    constructor(name, species) {
        this.name = name;
        this.species = species;
        this.hunger = 100;
        this.happiness = 100;
    }

    updateStatus(activity) {
        if (activity === "feed") this.hunger += 10;
        else if (activity === "play") this.happiness += 10;
        else throw new Error("Unknown activity");
    }
}
```

By tightly coupling the `Pet` class with status management, any future updates to the status logic would require modifying the `Pet` class, violating the Open-Closed Principle.
